A place to put quotes which I like, things that keep me going, lessons part and parcel of the game of life, mottos I have resonated with and books I have read.
=================================================================================================================

Mottos / Quotes:
============
Sink or swim.

Mind over matter.

Trust the process.

Work hard, play hard.

Inputs equals outputs.

When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.

You have made it this far why not just see it though.

You make a choice to commit, you can either do or not do.

Whatever happens, its part of the process, trust the process.

Experience is a good teacher, but she sends in terrific bills. 	- Minna Antrim

They fuck you up, your mum and dad. They may not mean to, but they do. - Philip larkin

Be nice to who you meet on the way up, you never know who you meet on the way down.
