Mottos / Quotes:
============

Trust the process.
Work hard, play hard.
Inputs equals outputs.
When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.
You have made it this far why not just see it though.
You make a choice to commit, you can either do or not do.
Whatever happens, its part of the process, trust the process.
Its the lows in life that make you truly appreciate the highs.
Experience is a good teacher, but she sends in terrific bills. 	- Minna Antrim
They fuck you up, your mum and dad. They may not mean to, but they do. - Philip larkin
Be nice to who you meet on the way up, you never know who you meet on the way down.
There are two types of people in this world; snakes and ladders, the snakes use the ladders to get to the top.
